# About

This is a collection of a few Rust programs I wrote to understand some concepts and/or experiment with ideas before starting with crates that implement full functionality.

Most programs should compile and you will be able to compile them with reasonably latest compiler, still 'Caveat Emptor'. Happy to accept PRs/issues if something does not work.
